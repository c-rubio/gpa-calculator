    This is a basic GPA calculator that can consider for various NC A&T GPA types, including the transcript GPA, honors GPA, and major GPA. 

Code standardization is observed (PEP8), as well as modular programming. Object-Oriented Programming is implemented with the usage of the "Course" class to  organize course information. The dictionary datastructure is used to store instances of courses.
