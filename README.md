    This project is based upon calculating the different GPA's that NC A&T implements. These include the transcript, honors, and major GPA. It functions as a practice for coding standards and object-oriented programming. It's still a work in progress, Since it functions at the moment, my next steps are continuing to improve code organization and readability.
